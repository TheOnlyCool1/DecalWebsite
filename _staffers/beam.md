Hi there! My name is Beam and I’m a 3rd year studying Cog Sci & Data Sci. Aside from programming, I love drawing and photography so please feel free to share your artworks with me! Lately, I’ve really been into narrative heavy games like Until Then, The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood, and Before your Eyes. Currently trying to finish Persona 5 Royal & Omori.
